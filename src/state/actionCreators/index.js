/*Consider breaking this down into separate actionCreator files if it becomes overly crowded!
Remember separation of concerns.
Import the action-types and export an action-creator function for each.
Each synchronous function should return an action object with a type and a payload -- these will be passed to the reducer.
Each asynchronous function should dispatch its action object (type/payload) to the reducer.
